- Use the same StandardCard module for new statuses (Click on FAB)
	 - Make props non-required and set default values (to blanks proab)
	 - Focus (and scroll to) new card to grab user's attention
	 - Have some way to distinguish a new card from existing cards (Highlight, opacity, shadow, background, etc)
	
Logic:
- Adds to local statusList store
- Upon submit, leave in statusList (and push to prod later)
- Upon cancel (No delete), remove from statusList
