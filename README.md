# Job App Tracker

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This tool should help job applicants track their applications throughout their job search process

It was designed to be a single page application (SPA) that would be simple to use, where applicants can ditch their messy Excel sheets and interact with a beautiful and responsive UI

As a student, while I was navigating my job search, I found it difficult to keep track of job applications and the more applications I sent, the harder it got. This tool comes with expected features that will help automate and simplify the entire process

## Timeline

- [ ] Develop frontend using Vue.js **(In Progress)**
- [ ] Develop the backend API using Flask
- [ ] Link the frontend with backend
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku so it can scale easily and be publicly accessible
- [ ] Work on extra features

## Features

- [ ] Idiot-proof Job Application Tracker (Simple to use and clean)
- [ ] Read user's emails (Link to Google's GMail API) and automatically add and update statuses
- [ ] Scrape the web to add company's icon to the UI
